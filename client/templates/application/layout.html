        Layouts allow you to reuse a common look and feel in multiple pages
        in your application so you don't have to duplicate the html and logic
        on every single page template.

        Layouts are just templates. But, inside of a layout you can use a special helper called yield.
        You can think of yield as a placeholder for content.
        The placeholder is called a region.
        The content will be "injected" into the region when we actually run our route.
        This lets us reuse the layout on many different pages,
        only changing the content of the yield regions.
